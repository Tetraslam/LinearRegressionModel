# My (Very Innaccurate) Linear Regression Model

### Made this for the 2021 Explore Hacks coding challenge 3.

### File descriptions:

- `pengu.py`: the main python file which runs the model.
- `pengu.csv`: the training data file for the model.
- `CostFuncAndGradient.py`: the python file which contains the cost function and gradient function.
- `FinalFuncCost.png`: a screenshot showing the model's accuracy (practically nonexistent)
- `Graph.png`: a screenshot of the graph that is generated.
